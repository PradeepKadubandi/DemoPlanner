Each row contains 1026 values, first 2 being robot position and the next 1024 being the image as numpy array.
No obstacles are generated, only robot for now.

Changes from version1:
----------------------
- Fixed values for background and robot (gradient = 0)
- background value = 0
- robot value = 255
